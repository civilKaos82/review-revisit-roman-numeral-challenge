# Review Revisit Roman Numeral 
 
##Summary 

In this challenge you will learn by reviewing and refactoring the code of others. Make sure you have completed the original Roman Numeral Challenge first!

##Releases

###Release 0 : Translate to plain English.

First, choose a solution to the  [Roman Numerals Challenge](../../../roman-numerals-challenge), pull a copy of this branch to your local repository and create a new `review` branch from it. Review the [How To Submit a Challenge README](../../../phase-1-guide/blob/master/resources/how_to_work_a_challenge.md) that you worked through last Monday for detailed instructions. Make sure to do all your work on the `review` branch.

Add an `explain.md` file to the repo and in this file, write two or three sentences that explain what this code does. Pretend that you're writing this for someone who knows nothing about computers. 

###Release 1 : Translate to pseudocode

Write pseudocode that clearly defines the steps.  Add the psuedocode below your English explanation in `explain.md`.

###Release 2 : Test the code

Add at least 3 simple tests to the code with a comment above each stating what they are testing. Run the code and make sure these tests pass.

###Release 3 : Refactor

Refactor the code. Make at least two significant improvements in the code itself, and in the `explain.md` file, add a section called `#Refactor` where you explain how you are refactoring the code and why.

Make sure the code still passes your tests.
